Legal Bills So Matt Can Join The National Guard

On February 20th, 2016 Matt's parents had him uneccessarily put under an involuntary psychiatric hold (5150). Since that time Matt's parents realized they made a grave mistake, and have apologized to Matt numerous times about it. Matt has returned to his career in the entertainment industry and lives a normal sane life. Never-the-less the legal fallout from his 5150 lingers on. 

Even though Matt was released from the involuntary psychiatric hold before the courts were even able to determine whether or not it was legal or necessary to keep him there, records of the 5150 hold continue to impact Matt's career, by creating red flags on employment background checks and most importantly are interfering with Matt pursuing his dream of joining the California National Guard. 

Because his dream of enlisting in the California National Guard is so important to him he's fighting the 5150 firearm's prohibition (the main issue holding up his enlistment.) His attorney has advised him that she'll need as much as $10,000 to win this case.

Any help would be so greatly appreciated!
